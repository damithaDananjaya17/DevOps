# What is devops 

### DevOps (Development + Operations) is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to enhance collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The primary goal is to automate andstreamline the processes of software delivery and infrastructure changes, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and faster, more reliable releases.

# A Simplified Analogy of DevOps

 Imagine you're a chef in a busy restaurant. You're responsible for creating delicious dishes,DevOps like the chef of the kitchen in the tech world.DevOps (Development + Operations) is the chef, focusing on creating new features and improvements. They're constantly innovating and experimenting, trying out new recipes and cooking techniques.


<span style="color: gray">
- New Recipe Development - 
       Brainstorms new dishes, experiments with flavors and ingredients, and writes down the recipes (code).


- Preparing the Kitchen - 
      Gathers ingredients (data), prepares them (cleans and formats the code), and begins the cooking process (testing and deploying the code).
   

- Cooking and Serving - 
     Continuously monitors the cooking process, makes adjustments as needed, and  ensures the dish is cooked to perfection (testing and refining the code).


- Cleaning Up - 
     Analyzes the finished dish, identifies areas for improvement, and cleans up any leftovers (code or resources).

# Characteristics of the Pre-DevOps Era 
<span style="color: gray"> The pre-DevOps era in software development was a starkly different landscape than what we see today. It was a time of siloed teams, rigid methodologies, and a lot of manual work, which often led to slow and unreliable software delivery. </span>

## Here are some key characteristics of the pre-DevOps era:
**Waterfall Model** - 
> The dominant methodology was the Waterfall model, a linear approach where each stage had to be completed before moving on to the next. This made it difficult to adapt to changes and respond quickly to new requirements.

**Siloed Teams** - 
> Developers, testers, and operations teams worked independently, often with little communication or collaboration. This created a "throw it over the wall" mentality, where each team blamed the other for problems.

**Manual Processes**
> Most tasks, from testing to deployment, were done manually. This was time-consuming and error-prone, leading to delays and inconsistencies.

**Limited Automation** - 
> There were few tools available to automate repetitive tasks, making it difficult to scale software development.

**Slow and Unreliable Delivery** - 
> Releases were infrequent and often buggy, causing frustration for both developers and users.

##  Emergency of DevOp
Emphasizing collaboration and communication between development and operations teams, the DevOps software development methodology did not appear overnight. Its roots can be traced back to several contributing factors and key turning points. 

<span style="color: darkorange">  **Agile movement** -  </span> 
>  The Agile movement, emerging in the 1990s and formally established in 2001, emphasized iterative development and collaboration, paving the way for DevOps' focus on faster delivery and team integration. ![Agile-PNG-HD-Isolated](https://github.com/damithaDananjaya17/DevOps/assets/159267886/28f58e85-900e-4ced-a4d7-652ccea12551)

<span style="color: darkorange">  **Automation** -  </span> 
>  The rise of automation tools throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC) simplified manual tasks, allowing teams to focus on higher-level activities.

<span style="color: darkorange">  **Cloud computing** -  </span> 
>   The emergence of cloud platforms provided a scalable and flexible environment for development and deployment, further facilitating collaboration and faster delivery.

## Key Factors Contributing to the Emergence of DevOps
-  Need for faster software delivery
-  Increased competition and evolving customer expectations drove the need for faster and more frequent software releases.
-  Inefficiencies of siloed teams
-  Traditional separation between development and operations led to communication gaps, delays, and finger-pointing.
-  Rise of automation tools
-  Automation enabled teams to focus on higher-level activities and eliminate manual work, improving efficiency and accuracy.
-  Cloud computing
-  Cloud platforms offered scalability, flexibility, and access to shared resources, facilitating collaboration and faster deployments.

# Key Principles of DevOps

**Collaboration** - 
>  DevOps emphasizes breaking down silos between development and operations teams, encouraging shared responsibilities and improved communication.

**Automation** - 
>  Automation is a core tenet of DevOps, involving the use of tools to automate manual and repetitive tasks in the software development and delivery pipeline.

**Continuous Integration (CI)** - 
>  Developers integrate their code into a shared repository multiple times a day, with automated builds and tests to detect and address issues early in the development process.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** - 
>  Continuous Deployment involves automatically deploying code changes to production environments after passing automated tests. This ensures rapid and reliable releases.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** - 
>  IaC involves managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, enabling consistent and repeatable infrastructure deployments.

**Monitoring and Feedback** - 
>  DevOps emphasizes continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure, providing real-time feedback to identify and address issues promptly.

## The Future of DevOps
Here are some key trends and predictions shaping the future of DevOps


- AI-powered automation
  
- Security-first approach - As technology advances and threats become more sophisticated, security will become an even greater priority within DevOps
  
- Shift towards self-service platforms - Teams will rely more on self-service platforms that allow them to access the tools and resources they need without relying on central IT teams.
  
- Rise of low-code/no-code tools - Low-code/no-code tools will become increasingly popular, enabling non-technical users to participate in the software development process.
  
- Collaboration across the entire value chain - DevOps will extend beyond traditional development and operations teams to include other stakeholders across the entire value chain, from marketing and sales to customer support.
