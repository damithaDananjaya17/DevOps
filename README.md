DevOps (Development + Operations) is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to enhance collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams.

•	Preparing the Kitchen - 
      Gathers ingredients (data), prepares them (cleans and formats the code), and begins the cooking process (testing and deploying the code).
   

•	Cooking and Serving - 
     Continuously monitors the cooking process, makes adjustments as needed, and  ensures the dish is cooked to perfection (testing and refining the code).


•	Cleaning Up -
