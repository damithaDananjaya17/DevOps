#### What is devops 

DevOps (Development + Operations) is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to enhance collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The primary goal is to automate and streamline the processes of software delivery and infrastructure changes, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and faster, more reliable releases.

Imagine you're a chef in a busy restaurant. You're responsible for creating delicious dishes,DevOps like the chef of the kitchen in the tech world.DevOps (Development + Operations) is the chef, focusing on creating new features and improvements. They're constantly innovating and experimenting, trying out new recipes and cooking techniques.

- New Recipe Development - 
       Brainstorms new dishes, experiments with flavors and ingredients, and writes down the recipes (code).


- Preparing the Kitchen - 
      Gathers ingredients (data), prepares them (cleans and formats the code), and begins the cooking process (testing and deploying the code).
   

- Cooking and Serving - 
     Continuously monitors the cooking process, makes adjustments as needed, and  ensures the dish is cooked to perfection (testing and refining the code).


- Cleaning Up - 
     Analyzes the finished dish, identifies areas for improvement, and cleans up any leftovers (code or resources).


 <code style="color : darkoranger"> Characteristics of the Pre-DevOps Era </code>
 The pre-DevOps era in software development was a starkly different landscape than what we see today. It was a time of siloed teams, rigid methodologies, and a lot of manual work, which often led to slow and unreliable software delivery.

## Here are some key characteristics of the pre-DevOps era:
**Waterfall Model** - 
The dominant methodology was the Waterfall model, a linear approach where each stage had to be completed before moving on to the next. This made it difficult to adapt to changes and respond quickly to new requirements.

**Siloed Teams** - 
> Developers, testers, and operations teams worked independently, often with little communication or collaboration. This created a "throw it over the wall" mentality, where each team blamed the other for problems.

**Manual Processes**
> Most tasks, from testing to deployment, were done manually. This was time-consuming and error-prone, leading to delays and inconsistencies.

**Limited Automation** - 
> There were few tools available to automate repetitive tasks, making it difficult to scale software development.

**Slow and Unreliable Delivery** - 
> Releases were infrequent and often buggy, causing frustration for both developers and users.
